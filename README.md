# text_to_image_using_goole_cloud

#For this project, you'll create a "word cloud" from a text by writing a script. This script needs to process the text,
# remove punctuation, ignore case and words that do not contain all alphabets, count the frequencies, 
#and ignore uninteresting or irrelevant words. A dictionary is the output of the calculate_frequencies function.
# The wordcloud module will then generate the image from your dictionary.

#no1.

# Here are all the installs and imports you will need for your word cloud script and uploader widget

!pip install wordcloud
!pip install fileupload
!pip install ipywidgets
!jupyter nbextension install --py --user fileupload
!jupyter nbextension enable --py fileupload

import wordcloud
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from IPython.display import display
import fileupload
import io
import sys

Final Project Help
Project goal 
Create a dictionary with words and word frequencies that can be passed to the generate_from_frequencies function of the WordCloud class.

Once you have the dictionary, use this code to generate the word cloud image:

123
cloud = wordcloud.WordCloud()
cloud.generate_from_frequencies(frequencies)
cloud.to_file("myfile.jpg")
Things to remember 
Before processing any text, you need to remove all the punctuation marks. To do this, you can go through each line of text, character-by-character, using the isalpha() method. This will check whether or not the character is a letter.
To split a line of text into words, you can use the split() method.
Before storing words in the frequency dictionary, check if theyâ€™re part of the "uninteresting" set of words (for example: "a", "the", "to", "if"). Make this set a parameter to your function so that you can change it if necessary.
Input file
For the input file, you need to provide a file that contains text only. For the text itself, you can copy and paste the contents of a website you like. Or you can use a site like Project Gutenberg to find books that are available online. You could see what word clouds you can get from famous books, like a Shakespeare play or a novel by Jane Austen.
